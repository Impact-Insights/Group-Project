1. Data Exploration (EDA)
 * Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
 * Get summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
 * Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
 * Identify and handle outliers.
2. Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
 * Generate histograms and boxplots for numerical variables.
 * Create bar charts to visualize the distribution of categorical variables.
 * Use correlation matrices to analyze relationships between numerical variables.
3. Data Visualization
 * Create line charts to show sales trends over time.
 * Use scatter plots to analyze revenue vs. profit margin.
 * Generate heatmaps to identify high-performing regions.
 * Build bar plots showing product category performance across different regions.
4. Insights & Business Recommendations
 * Identify the best-performing region based on revenue and profit.
 * Find which product category generates the highest revenue.
 * Recommend strategies to improve sales in underperforming regions.


The dataset consists of sales transactions from various regions over a one-year period. It contains the following columns:
 * Date – The transaction date
 * Region – The geographical region where the sale took place
 * Product Category – The type of product sold
 * Units Sold – The number of units sold in a transaction
 * Revenue – The revenue generated from the sale
 * Profit Margin (%) – The percentage of profit made from the sale
 * Customer Type – Whether the customer is a new or returning customer


The aim of this case study is to analyze a dataset containing sales performance data across different regions.
Candidates to explore and visualize the data using Jupyter notebook to uncover trends and insights that could help businesses make data-driven decisions.
